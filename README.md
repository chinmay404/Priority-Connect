# Priority-Connect

## **Basic Idea:**

The project aims to design and implement a sophisticated contact management system that allows users to customize communication priorities for different contact groups. The system will intelligently manage incoming calls and messages, ensuring that users can focus on essential interactions while minimizing interruptions from less critical contacts.

## **üí° Ideas:**

- **Smart Grouping:** Implement an algorithm that categorizes contacts into groups based on various factors such as relationship, frequency of interaction, and communication medium.
- **Priority Settings:** Enable users to set communication priority levels for each group, defining the actions the system should take for incoming calls or messages.
- **Auto-Rejection & Custom Responses:** Automatically reject calls or messages from specified groups during user-defined periods. Additionally, send personalized SMS responses to let the contact know the user's current availability.
- **Geo-Fencing Integration:** Integrate location data to dynamically adjust contact priorities based on the user's current location, optimizing communication during work, travel, or leisure.
- **Machine Learning Insights:** Leverage machine learning algorithms to provide users with insights into their communication patterns and suggest optimal priority settings.

## **‚öôÔ∏è Modules:**

1. **Contact Management:**
    - Group contacts based on predefined criteria or user-defined rules.
    - Allow users to create, edit, and delete contact groups.
2. **Priority Settings:**
    - Provide an interface for users to set priority levels for each contact group.
    - Define actions for each priority level (auto-reject, custom response, etc.).
3. **Communication Handling:**
    - Intercept incoming calls and messages to determine the contact's group and priority.
    - Apply the specified actions based on the priority settings.
4. **Geo-Fencing Logic:**
    - Implement algorithms to utilize location data and adjust contact priorities accordingly.
5. **User Insights:**
    - Incorporate machine learning algorithms to analyze communication habits and provide actionable insights.

## **Features:**

- **Personalized Communication:** Users can tailor communication settings to match their daily routines and preferences.
- **Productivity Enhancement:** Minimize interruptions from non-urgent contacts during focused work hours.
- **Smart Automation:** The system intelligently handles communication actions, reducing manual int
- ervention.
